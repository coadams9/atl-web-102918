# Intro to Object Orientation

## Objectives

* Define `object` in programming domain
* Explain the concept of sending messages
* Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
* Explain the difference between a class and an instance
* Pass arguments to `new` by defining an initialize method in class
* Create instance methods
* Call methods on `self` explicitly

## Deliverables

Here is a simple example of a pokemon using a hash:

```ruby
## Does this need a name? How about a trainer?
pikachu = { kind: 'electric', lvl: 5, hp: 35, atk: 55, def: 30 }
```

Write an implementation of Pokemon capable of the following:

* Can growl
* Can display its stats
* Can change HP
* Can level up
