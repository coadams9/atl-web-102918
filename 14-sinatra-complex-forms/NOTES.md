## Mod 2 - How the hell do servers even?

### Week 1, Day 2 - Complex Forms and Associations

### Concepts...

* more forms & parameters review
  * why two steps?
    * one route to show the user a form
    * another route to process the data when the form sends it back
  * what happens when i submit a form?
    * it makes an HTTP request to the method and action specified
  * connection between inputs and params
    * in the controller method for a post/put,
      each input in the form is one of the params
* REST
  * what does it stand for? (okay, forget that)
  * why do we do it

### To build...

* edit a book.
* boss wants me to support listing authors
  * maybe even adding an author with a list of books? ... T_T
    * how do i pass an array of things through a form?
