## Mod 2 - How the hell do servers even?

### Week 1, Day 1 - Moar MVC

### Concepts...

* params
* "HTTP is stateless"
* redirect
* forms
* maybe `set :method_override, true`
  * see also: `<input type="hidden" value="PATCH" name="_method">`

### To build...

* get info on a single book
* create a new book
* edit a book.
* destroy a book? why would anyone ever do this?
